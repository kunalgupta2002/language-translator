# language-translator
This project implements a language translator from English to French using neural networks, specifically LSTM and RNN architectures. It includes comprehensive data processing steps such as data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, tokenization, and padding. TensorFlow and Keras are used for implementation and training.

Features
1) Neural Network Architecture: Utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) for sequence modeling.
2) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Includes steps to clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for training.
3) Tokenization and Padding: Handles tokenization of input sequences and padding of sequences to ensure uniform length.
4) Data Visualization: Visualizes the processed data to gain insights into its distribution and characteristics.
5) Implementation Details: Built using TensorFlow and Keras for ease of implementation and performance optimization.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
